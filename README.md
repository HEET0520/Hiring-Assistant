# Hiring Assistant
 
The interview process in RecruitX starts with an automated conversation, where the AI-driven hiring assistant interacts with candidates, gathers their details, and assesses their responses. The collected data, including technical assessments and chat history, is then stored in Supabase for recruiters to review and make informed hiring decisions.
